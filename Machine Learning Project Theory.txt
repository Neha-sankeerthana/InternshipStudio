 üìò Machine Learning Project Theory: Predicting Students‚Äô Math Scores

### üéØ Objective

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict a student's math score based on various features such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course status. Understanding these factors‚Äô influence can help educators and policymakers identify gaps and optimize interventions for academic improvement.

### üß† Hypothesis

> Student performance in mathematics can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using demographic and educational background data.

We hypothesize that:

1. Students who complete test preparation courses will generally perform better in math.
2. Socioeconomic indicators such as lunch type (free/reduced vs. standard) may correlate with performance.
3. Parental education level could positively influence a student‚Äôs math score due to academic support at home.

### ü§ñ Models Applied

 Linear Regression (LR)
 Lasso Regression
 Ridge Regression
 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
 Decision Tree Regressor (DT)
 Random Forest Regressor (RF)

### üìê Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
MSE(Mean Squared Error)
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)

These metrics help measure how close the predictions are to the actual values and how well the model generalizes.

### üîç Observations

Linear models performed decently but might underfit due to linear assumptions.
Tree-based models like Random Forest performed best, capturing nonlinear relationships.
Test Preparation Course showed a significant impact on math score prediction.
Parental education level and lunch type revealed latent socio-economic effects on performance.

### üìå Conclusion

 The project confirms that student math performance can be predicted using demographic and academic indicators.
 Random Forest Regressor yielded the highest R¬≤ score, suggesting it is the most suitable model for this dataset.
 This model can help educators identify at-risk students early and suggest tailored academic interventions.

### üß© Future Scope

Incorporate more granular features such as school quality, hours studied, or teacher-student ratio.
 Explore ensemble models like **XGBoost** or **Gradient Boosting**.
 Extend the model to predict other subject scores and find cross-subject correlations.
